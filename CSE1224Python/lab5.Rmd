## 1

Each node has a key which is the node label and a value which is a list of 
the connected nodes

```{python}
C5 = {
  0: [4, 1],
  1: [0, 2],
  2: [1, 3],
  3: [2, 4],
  4: [3, 0]
}
```

## 2

Each entry [i,j] is a 1 when node i connects to node j and 0 otherwise

```{python}
C5 = [[0,1,0,0,1],
      [1,0,1,0,0],
      [0,1,0,1,0],
      [0,0,1,0,1],
      [1,0,0,1,0]]
```
