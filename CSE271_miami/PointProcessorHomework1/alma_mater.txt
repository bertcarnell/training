Alma Mater

Old Miami, from thy hillcrest,

Thou hast watched the decades roll.
While thy sons have quested from thee,
Sturdy-hearted, pure of soul.

Old Miami, New Miami,
Days of old and days to be;
Weave the story of the glory,
Our Miami, here's to thee.

Aging in thy simple splendor,
Thou the calm, and they the storm,
Thou didst give them joy in conquest,
Strength from thee sustained their arm.

Thou shalt stand a constant beacon,
Crimson tow'rs against the sky;
Men shall ever seek thy guiding,
Power like thine shall never die.
