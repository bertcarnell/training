Training courses and my solutions.

## Goal
My goal with this repository is to collect notes on on-line classes that I take, focused primarily on data science.

## Copyright + License
Please note that the included MIT license and my associated copyright are for the code that I produced, and for changes that I made to existing code.  Each of these classes comes with a significant amount of copyrighted material, some of which is unavoidably copied here as part of **my** fair use.  Please understand all applicable restrictions before you copy or fork this repository.  I'm happy to help.
